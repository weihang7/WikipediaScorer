   1. Definitions.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "The" is a definite grammatical article that implies necessarily that an 
      entity it articulates is presupposed; something already mentioned, or
      completely specified later in that same sentence, or assumed already 
      completely specified.

   2. Read permissions. You may not read any portion of the Work or Derivative Works,
      including licensing files and documentation.

   3. Line breaks. When creating Derivative Works, you must insert line breaks such that the line does not go off the page when read by a human reader on an appropriately-sized screen, under normal conditions. Failure to copmly with this rule may result in the invocation of copyright infrigement.

   4. Redistribution. You may not reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form.
	
   5. Usage. You may not use the Work, or copies of the Work or Derivative Works.

   6. Trademarks. You may only apply your trademark if it is the Pokemon (c) logo.

   7. Warranty. We guarantee that the source code will be the same in 10 years.

   8. Limitation of Liability. You are liable for everything.
